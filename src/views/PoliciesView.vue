<h2>Harassment</h2>

<p>No attendee shall harass a guest, staff member, volunteer, another attendee, or other individual present in the venue. Any such behavior may lead to expulsion from the convention and revocation of your badge without refund. The convention reserves the right to remove any signage displaying what, or individuals acting in a way, it considers offensive or in disagreement with its policies and philosophy, including any promotion of hate, religious/anti-religious proselytization, unauthorized solicitation, anti-feminism, or similar.</p>

<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, political affiliation, body appearance, race, religion, or gender identity; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.  </p>

<p>If you, as an attendee, feel harassed, you may inform the offender that you would like the harassing behavior to stop immediately. If you are not comfortable doing this, you may contact a Protospiel staff member who will address the concern.</p>

<h2>Inclusivity</h2>

<p>Protospiel strives to create a safe and inclusive space that welcomes gamers from all walks of life. We hope to build a community space that includes all gamers.</p>

<p>We celebrate all races, ethnicities, body types, the full spectrum of genders, all sexual identities, and persons with all ranges of abilities and ability challenges. While this list of identities is not complete or perfect, we function with a spirit of inclusiveness.</p>

<p>We believe that a diverse range of experiences and perspectives is absolutely necessary in building a thriving and healthy gaming community. We welcome you to share your perspective and experiences with us at Protospiel.
